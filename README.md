# Reinforcement_Learning_Simulation
Applying reinforcement learning techniques in real robotics simulation 

This is based on the works of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04349.pdf this paper 
but instead of using LIDAR, I tried using an array of ultrasonic sensors 

A dueling deep neural network is used and is based on the PyTorch framework 
the results are highly arbitary, still under hyperparameter tuning. 
The reward system is based on the paper though they havn't fully explained 
the academic approach in detail hence I have applied my own academic style 
approach. 

I have also included models used in the simulation, you can donwload and 
change the address in config file to work with them.
