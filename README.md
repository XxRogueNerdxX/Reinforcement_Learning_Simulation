# Reinforcement_Learning_Simulation
Applying reinforcement learning techniques in real robotics simulation 

Download the simulation_connect file and then save it along with the remoteApi file provided in Coppiella(Coppelia -> programming -> remoteApi_bindings -> lib)

Also save the sim.py and simCons.py file along with the remoteApi file. 

Then open the your simulation and then run the code. You can insert your required code after the "if" code. It would be marked accordinly 

The code is writting simlare to the OpenAI gym file. It has a step function which would take a step funciton. After doing your task call the end function to end the simulation

Good Luck
